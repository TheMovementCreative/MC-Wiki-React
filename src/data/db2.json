The students have to build a line and course out of vault boxes that suites six rolls of the dice. That is, if a coach rolls 2,5,6,4,2,1 the students will build a setup where dash-turn vault-reverse-lazy-dash-speed makes sense. This helps students work on awkward vault transitions and also visualize how certain movements fit into specific spaces. Students are allowed to bring in vault boxes but once a box is placed it cannot be moved. Students can start in different parts of the “course” and try to complete the same sequence of movements for added difficulty.    Coaches can roll the dice (or use a similar phone app) six times at the beginning of the activity or let the students build their line/course one roll at a time a la “Add On.” This game is somewhat similar to Add On, but the randomization creates opportunities for students to work on awkward or unfamiliar vault transitions on both sides that they wouldn’t necessarily create for themselves. Coaches should pick movements that emphasize the focus skills and also tend to flow well into each other. Coaches can also mix focus skills with advanced classes."

Generally, swinging the inside foot works best for slow-moving lazy vaults used in tight spaces or as a connecting vault in a flow line. Swinging the outside foot allows athletes to run the fastest into their lazy (this is often also called a “thief” vault) and generate more exit power. It also works best as a transition into the dash vault. The plyo approach can develop significant power, generally more so than the outside leg from a limited run-up, but requires a more diagonal approach angle and cannot be used with as much speed as the outside leg lazy/thief. The plyo lazy is also convenient as a transition from heavier impact since it is essentially a two-footed takeoff."

Coaches should be sure to mat any areas where students may attempt thread rolls/flips through the lasers. Coaches should also create consequences for touching the tape (conditioning circuit), since it is a pain in the butt to re-tape an area once it’s up and some students will just barrel through a space instead of putting the effort into figuring out the technique.

When coach says “go,” students push up into a 5-step long jump max out, (2) students begin lying belly-down, then push to two feet and try 3 consecutive plyos on flat ground for distance, and (3) students begin seated with their back against a vault box. When coach says go, they have to stand up and sprint around the vault box into a 5-step kong for exit distance (on a second vault box).    Again, the above are just examples.

Whereas the resi mat in the precision version of this game is easy to move, a wall/heavy vault box is not. A good option is to set up stations of varying distances to account for different power levels. Alternately, coaches can encourage more powerful students to cat abort higher on the wall than their peers. Make sure students understand how to cat abort safely and consistently before attempting this drill. Ankle injuries are common when practicing cat aborts with increasing distance - to minimize risk of ankle injuries, have students practice cat aborts where they are going slightly up to the wall/box instead of level or contacting once they start to come down."
