List of explorations
 

 
 
Avoidance

practicing awareness and control by avoiding others in movement
Materials
Instructions
Fits with any movement type in any environment.
Great for teaching awareness of surroundings.
Within boundaries, try to move around as much as possible for 20 seconds.
Move only in QM, or you’re out.
If you come into physical contact with someone, you and that person are out.
If you cease traversing, you’re out.
It may be useful to give goals, such as “touch as many of x things as you can for points.”
Shift the ‘height’ of the ceiling to get QM avoidance going.
Use ground is lava for additional difficulty.
In ground is lava mode, you can potentially deactivate QM.

 
 
Add On

Each students adds a move to a movement pattern
Materials
None
Instructions
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to advanced)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: Students can play in large or small groups. One student begins the game by performing a movement. The next student copies that movement and adds one of their own, and so on. Students can either drop out if they are unable to complete the route or can adjust it to a variation they are comfortable with.
Coach Notes: Coaches can guide the game around a certain focus skill or allow it to evolve naturally. If coaches have students with diverse skill levels in one class it may be best to separate into smaller groups.

 
 
Hurdle Lasers

exploration of a lazer field with add-on
Materials
red paracord bells optional
Instructions
Activity Description: Use tape/string to create several “laser courses” for students to jump through. These courses can be as simple as hurdles over tape at various heights, but can also include other tape shapes (triangles, vertical lines, horizontal gaps, squares, etc.) that will challenge students’ ingenuity and ability. Once students have moved through the course several times, have them work together to create add-on style routes through the course.
Coach Notes: Coaches should be sure to mat any areas where students may attempt thread rolls/flips through the lasers. Coaches should also create consequences for touching the tape (conditioning circuit), since it is a pain in the butt to re-tape an area once it’s up and some students will just barrel through a space instead of putting the effort into figuring out the technique. String can avoid this problem to a certain extent but takes longer to put up.

 
 
That was Easy

an exploration in making something more difficult for yourself or others
Materials
Instructions
Say: “That’s easy doesn’t make sense in parkour, because parkour is about finding ways to make things difficult, on purpose”
You win by making something (standing balance) progressively more difficult
The challenge is not making it too easy or impossible
Personal space for movement, balance trainers optional
Giving directions to a partner until they fail
Be respectful, play to keep playing not to win
Zone, you can go around the circle building challenges as you go

 
 
lazy clears

seeing how high and far of a hurdle or gap you can clear with a lazy
Materials
vault
soft thing to clear
Instructions
Activity Description: Begin with students practicing lazy vault from all three takeoff styles. After 2-3 reps with each approach style, use a thin PVC pipe/tape/low vault box to create a hurdle on the exit side. Have students clear the hurdle using all three styles at first. As the hurdle distance increases, have students focus on inside leg takeoff and plyo takeoff techniques.
Coach Notes: For students not immediately comfortable with lazy clears, begin with a soft obstacle like a PVC pipe or stack of mats. As students become more proficient, move to harder obstacles to challenge students mentally. Coaches can also adjust the height of the clear in addition to the distance – intermediate and advanced students should be challenged by hurdles that are level or higher than the takeoff.

 
 
acceleration positions

working on quick action from different resting positions
Materials
Instructions
Activity Description: Another activity geared toward getting students
comfortable with speed and acceleration. Have students begin each drill from a relaxed position and accelerate into a powerful jump or jump sequence. Coaches can adapt the initial position and specific jump sequence to each class’s needs but some examples are: (1) students begin lying belly-down on the ground. When coach says “go,” students push up into a 5-step long jump max out, (2) students begin lying belly-down, then push to two feet and try 3 consecutive plyos on flat ground for distance, and (3) students begin seated with their back against a vault box. When coach says go, they have to stand up and sprint around the vault box into a 5-step kong for exit distance (on a second vault box).
Coach Notes: Again, the above are just examples. The key is to challenge students’ ability to accelerate into challenges from various static positions using strides, plyos, short sprints, and vaults. Coaches should feel free to adapt the general principle of relaxed static position to powerful jump/vault challenge as needed based on their lesson plan and focus skills.

 
 
Follow the River/ Dragon

Follow the leader with rotating leaders
Materials
None
Instructions
Duration: 10-20 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to Advanced)
Intensity: Low to high
Activity Description: Have students form a single file line (the “river”) behind the coach. Students try to stay within 3 feet of the person in front of them – if a gap opens up, they prioritize filling the gap over following the exact movements of the leader. Coach begins to move through the gym at a speed of their choice (generally begin slowly at walking speed) with students repeating the movements behind them while maintaining distance. When coach calls out “next,” the coach moves to the back and the next person in line becomes the new leader. The new leader is allowed to set as quick or as slow of a pace as they like. Rotate leaders every 30-60 seconds. The coach always has the ability to slow down or speed up the pace of the game regardless of who is in front.
Coach Notes: Encourage students to start with a slow tempo and do something different with the space than the person in front of them. Each student should try to take their own route. Coaches can also choose one skill in particular to focus on (dyno, dash vault, underbar) and ask each student to put it in while they are leading the river.

 
 
Balance Drops

Transition from balance on rail to support
Materials
Bars/ wall with overgrip
Instructions
Duration: 5-10 minutes
Age/Experience: 8+ (Beginner to Advanced)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: Students begin balanced on a rail or thin wall with overgrip. Students then transition to a support position or full hang. Beginner and intermediate students can go one hand/foot at a time while more advanced students should try to jump straight into support from both feet.
Coach Notes: Coaches should start with a bar/wall that is no more than chest high for their students. Add height and momentum into the initial balanced position as students get more comfortable (i.e. running bounce into support, etc.)

 
 
Lache Pivot Kick

Progression for 180 laches
Materials
Bar, foam block
Instructions
Duration: 5-10 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to Intermediate)
Intensity: Low
Activity Description: Coach stands next to the bar and has students warm up with several 180 turns or pivots on the bar. Once students have done 2-3 turns each, take a foam block and hold it at an appropriate height/distance from the bar. Students will try to tap or kick the block at the peak of their pivot. The goal of this drill is to get students to ride the swing as much as possible before turning. Coaches should put the block at a height that challenges the students to generate and maintain as much power as they can comfortably handle.
Coach Notes: Coaches may get kicked in the foot while holding the block and should make sure their bodies are out of the way when performing this drill. Students should be kicking the block with their “outside” leg when doing the pivot (i.e. if they pivot left, kicking with the right leg at the top of their swing). Do not have students perform this drill if they are not comfortable and consistent doing a standard 180/pivot.

 
 
Tennis Tap

Using a tennis ball to gain reaction speed and awareness of the balls of your feet
Materials
one tennis ball per two people

A large wall near an open space is preferable
Instructions
Activity Description: Students pair up. Each pair is given a tennis ball. One student sits at an angle with her back against a wall and both feet up off the ground. The other student gently tosses a tennis ball from standing and calls “left” or “right” as it leaves their hand. The seated student uses the ball of that foot to try and tap the tennis ball back to their partner. After 10 tosses, they switch roles. Variation 1: The seated student has her eyes closed and is only allowed to open them once they hear their partner say “left” or “right.” Variation 2: The seated student’s role is the same as Variation 1, but the standing student bounces the ball on one hop to their partner and calls “left” or “right” just before the ball bounces.
Coach Notes: As in all ball games, younger students may need to be encouraged to pass the ball gently. Participants can choose a penalty for bad throws if necessary. The seated student should try to tap the ball with their foot, not kick the ball using their entire leg.Seated students should also try to tap the ball back to their partner when possible. Coaches want to isolate and develop control of the foot/ankle. Students should prioritize ball of foot contact every time. For more advanced groups, coaches can penalize non-ball of foot contact.

 
 
Cat Max Out!

testing maximum huckability for catleaps
Materials
wall vault box slant mat
Instructions
Activity Description: Replace the resi mat in the standard “Max Out!!!” game with a slanted or flat wall/vault box. Have students perform cat aborts to the wall from 3 steps, 5 steps, and 7 steps of run-up. If students are able to cat abort from a distance comfortably, coaches can have them work on cat leaps at the same distance.
Coach Notes: Whereas the resi mat in the precision version of this game is easy to move, a wall/heavy vault box is not. A good option is to set up stations of varying distances to account for different power levels. Alternately, coaches can encourage more powerful students to cat abort higher on the wall than their peers. Make sure students understand how to cat abort safely and consistently before attempting this drill. Ankle injuries are common when practicing cat aborts with increasing distance - to minimize risk of ankle injuries, have students practice cat aborts where they are going slightly up to the wall/box instead of level or contacting once they start to come down.

 
 
Worst Day Ever

fun way to practice bails
Materials
Instructions
This is one way to let people get silly while practicing their bails.
Set up a course or have students pick an objective to which they must traverse.
Make sure students understand they don’t have to do a challenge if they don’t want to.
Try to have as many people on the course as possible.
Partner up.
One partner tries to complete the course at a fairly slow pace.
Other partner will then yell random mishaps and hazards that you will have to bail out of.
Light contact is allowed.
Example: Right hand slips because it’s wet. Random cyclist is coming and about to run you over.
Switch after each run/through
Try making it so there’s a two way stream, and students have to negotiate other movers as well as their current hazard.
You can add a ‘soft’ ground is lava condition, or place a penalty for number of times ground ground was touched.
Consider making a team vs team race, but where one partner runs the course and the other tries to slow the opposing team’s runner by calling calamity down upon them.

 
 
Crouching Traceur, Hidden Landing

practicing landing from a surprised position
Materials
Instructions
Activity Description: The “jumper” begins the game by choosing a general area on the floor they want to jump/swing/catback to. Then, the “jumper” closes their eyes and the “hider” places a precision trainer in the general area. The precision trainer can be placed in any orientation (straight, sideways, slanted, etc.) so long as it is centered or touches part of (for advanced groups) the area the “jumper” points out. Once the “hider” has placed the precision trainer, the “jumper” jumps/swings/catbacks with their eyes closed toward the general area where they know the trainer is. In the air, the “jumper” opens their eyes and tries to adapt to the orientation and stick the precision trainer. The “jumper” can open their eyes as early in the jump as they need to feel comfortable.
Coach Notes: Remind students the goal is to challenge (not trick, or beat) your partners by placing the trainer in an interesting way. Coaches should walk through the game with the entire class once or twice before splitting them into groups and allowing them to play on their own. The precision trainer can be replaced with tape lines for beginner groups.

 
 
Ragdoll

A test of midair reaction to adjust and find safe landing technique
Materials
a soft surface with an elevated surface nearby
Instructions
Activity Description: Students jump from a vault box down to a resi several feet below. In mid-air, coaches give the student a gentle push and students have to land safely on the resi or the 8” stacked pads surrounding it. This game can be a fun way for students to relax and build air awareness for drops, bails, and trampoline skills.
Coach Notes: Coaches should only play this game with students they are comfortable with, and with students who are relatively light. The set-up works best with two coaches, one on either side of the students’ takeoff point. Coaches should be next to the students’ takeoff point, not in front of it - this way, students have a clear landing space. Students should try to avoid landing on their feet, instead learning how to fall onto their stomach, back, and side. If students use feet or hands for a landing, it should be to assist a fall to their stomach, back, or side, not to absorb impact. Make sure students are confident with fall positions on a small drop before increasing drop size.

 
 
Tornado Rolls

Learning to react and make safe and quick decisions and be prepared to move and roll in every direction and environment
Materials
Instructions
Activity Description: Have students partner up and find space on the open floor. The “roller” begins by standing with their eyes closed. Their partner gives them a gentle push from a random direction and the roller has to move with the push and roll in that direction - that could mean forward, sideways, or backwards. The roller is allowed to open their eyes once they are pushed but no earlier. Once both students are comfortable as the “roller,” add in the tornado. Have the roller spin in place with their eyes closed. Their partner will then give them a push as before and the roller has to adapt to both rotation and external force. The goal is to become comfortable reacting to external stimulus with rolls in all directions and to eliminate subconscious roll preference.
Coach Notes: Coaches may want to monitor younger students and make sure they understand what “gentle” push means. Coaches may also want to start this game on spring floor for younger or less experienced students. As students become more comfortable, they can move to harder surfaces and be pushed more aggressively by their partners. Coaches can also add objects like vault boxes into the field of play for advanced students to avoid/use during their rolls.

 
 
Dyno Feet

testing different foot placements and techniques for dynos
Materials
space for several different dynos
Instructions
Activity Description: Coaches set several dynos. Have students attempt each dyno with static feet, knee drive from floor (for beginners), and knee drive from hang. Intermediate/advanced students can also attempt dynos with knee drive and step, or with hand/foot match and a jump.
Coach Notes: Make sure students understand and are focusing on each basic technique as they switch between them. Dynos should be challenging but possible for all students. Coaches can use an actual obstacle for the dyno goal or tape/chalk marks.

 
 
Max Out

practicing maximum power without focusing on quality of landing
Materials
Resi-Mat or Pit
Instructions
Activity Description: Begin by placing the resi mat an appropriate distance from the students’ takeoff point. Limit student run-up to 3-5 steps and have them jump/vault/swing as far as they can on to the resi mat. Students can use a standard four point landing or land in a seat drop. Coaches can have students practice both types of landings to challenge proprioception. Once students are comfortable running into the jump with 3-5 steps, increase to 7 (for 5 attempts) then 10 (if space allows). For laches, this would translate to maxing out on a standard swing, then a medium cast, then a full cast/giant for high level students. The goal here is not to work on perfect landings but to get students comfortable with accelerating to full speed on running jumps, big vaults, and/or max laches. Coaches should have students practice from both feet with no step-up and varying step-up heights.
Coach Notes: For more advanced classes, coaches can have students practice their max out drills on one of the big vault boxes (preferably on a slight upwards running pre to minimize landing impact). Coaches should make sure students are landing safely with limited run-up before expanding. When practicing with swings/vaults, coaches should be aware of any cues that may help students avoid injury (knee bashes, peeling out, etc.) as they add speed and power to their approach.

 
 
Handstand Scissor Kicks

trying to kick up and switch feet in handstand, as many times as you can switch
Materials
Instructions
Activity Description: Kick to handstand is a prerequisite for this drill. Have students kick to handstand, then try to land on their kicking leg (forcing them to switch feet in the air). Once students are able to switch feet once, challenge students to switch feet twice, three times, etc. This drill can help students understand heel drive and control their kick when going into handstand.
Coach Notes: Coach should be prepared to spot any students who are not comfortable falling forward out of a handstand, either into a roll or a bridge.
