List of drills
 

 
 
Rail Running Patterns

practicing quick footwork on rails
Materials
balance rails
Instructions
Activity Description: Show students basic rail running step patterns (left over right/right over left, left behind right/right behind left, side shuffle, etc.) and have students work on them in isolation - that is, taking 2-4 steps as quickly as they can and no more. Once students are comfortable repeating a pattern, challenge them to combine multiple patterns together and create longer runs.
Coach Notes: The goal of this drill is to ingrain successful rail running patterns in isolation before implementing them into longer challenges. Coaches should make sure students are starting small and getting comfortable repeating the basic patterns before they start to combine them into 5+ step runs.

 
 
Ragdoll

practicing falling unexpectedly
Materials
Instructions
Try to have open space.
Above all, protect your head.
Use soft, fleshy parts of your body, rather than bones and joints.
Keep an eye out for other participants and features of the environment.
On the coach’s mark, such as a clap, a snap, or a signal, participants will pretend like they have lost all force in muscles, crumpling to the ground.
It will be helpful to think about jelly limbs.
In the right crowd, thinking about how body physics work in Bethesda also works.
Start at half speed/slow motion, then move up to regular speed.
Make sure you’re exploring various directions in which you could ragdoll.
As you’re exploring directions, think about extending/intensifying your ragdolling. Rather than falling into a general area, see how far out you can get while still being ‘lifeless’.
Consider GENTLY ragdolling into someone and how their energy might affect yours.

 
 
cast flop

practicing full cast in a safe way
Materials
bar
resi mat
Instructions
Activity Description: Place the resi mat under a low (4-6’) bar with 8” mats added as needed. Have students cast on the bar, extend as they would for a lache precision, then land on the resi in a front drop position (shoulders, chest, and thighs hit with feet near butt) while still holding the bar. To reduce impact, the mats should be almost as tall as the bar. The goal of this drill is to get students comfortable with staying straight and tapping on their cast - if the mats are in an awkward place it will do more harm than good.
Coach Notes: Because the mats need to be stacked very high for this to work, many students may have trouble starting their cast from support on the bar. Other options include having the students start balanced on the bar and “stepping” into a cast, or having students stand on the resi then jumping into a cast position.

 
 
Regrab Flop

practicing flops as a way to get better at cats
Materials
resi mat
bar
Instructions
Activity Description: Coach sets a resi mat near a bar suitable for laches. Students lache precision the resi mat. After 2-3 reps, have students try to lache into a front drop on the resi mat. If necessary, coaches can stack 8” pads on top to increase the height of the resi/reduce impact. Ultimately, students will try to lache into front drop on the resi with their hands on the far edge of the mat. This recreates the regrab position and can help students get comfortable gauging distance and timing during extension.
Coach Notes: Students should be hitting bellies and thighs first with their feet tucked up toward their butt. If possible, students should have head neutral to avoid whiplash. Coaches should make sure students understand how to front drop on trampoline before working this drill. Coach should adjust the lache distance to the resi after 2-3 attempts so that students can practice adjusting their power while still landing in a strong “catch” position.

 
 
Step Turn

Step vault onto rail and turn into cat hang
Materials
Rail at height, wall
Instructions
Duration: 5 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to intermediate)
Intensity: Low
Activity Description: Have students step vault over a small bar or wall. Then, have students step vault with their hand turned and transition into a support. Once students are comfortable transitioning from a step vault into support, have them try a step turn vault into cat hang. As students become comfortable with this transition, have them eliminate the step on the wall/rail and go for a standard turn vault.
Coach Notes: The step turn or turn vault is easiest on a bar or thin wall where overgrip is possible. Coaches should try to find a setup that is not too intimidating while teaching this technique. Do not have students turn vault or step turn at height until they have shown they can transition consistently into cat leap. Make sure students learn to step turn and turn vault on both sides.

 
 
One foot cat bail

practicing one footed bails
Materials
a wall
Instructions
Activity Description: Students begin by practicing a one-footed cat abort position on the wall and pushing off. Once they are comfortable pushing off of the wall with both hands and one foot, have them jump lightly into the wall and push off. Add distance as students become stronger and more comfortable.
Coach Notes: If taken through this activity too quickly, there is a high risk of ankle/Achilles injury. Make sure students understand that the one-footed cat abort is a compromised bail position – and a dangerous one at that. Their go-to should always be two feet on the wall, especially with momentum.

 
 
Handstand Hops

practicing hopping while in handstand
Materials
Instructions
Activity Description: Students begin with several handstands or handstand walks. Then, students kick up into handstand and hop once on their hands. Once students finish their hop, they step back down to standing. Have students do sets of 10 hops, one at a time.
Coach Notes: This exercise should only be done with students who are comfortable holding a freestanding handstand for 5-15 seconds minimum. When students hop on their hands, the power should come from the initial leg drive and a quick push from the shoulders. This is an excellent drill for preparing students to double kong. It can also be used to improve stability and confidence with dive kongs and laches from cast.

 
 
Ground Step

QM Drill starting in push up position
Materials
Floor space
Instructions
Duration: 5-10 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to Intermediate)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: Have students begin on the floor in pushup position with wide feet. Slowly explain and demonstrate how to move from pushup into a step vault position on the floor. Have students follow as you go. Begin moving slowly but fluidly. Once students are comfortable transitioning between pushup and step vault on both sides, take them through a small circuit of transitions at various speeds.
Coach Notes: Coaches can speed up and slow down their circuit to challenge students’ balance and strength. This can make an excellent warm-up or closer for beginner groups in particular. Coaches can also transition to other positions from the step vault, like the crab, bridge, and tunnel/downward dog.

 
 
Vault Steps

practicing taking a specific few steps between vaults
Materials
more than one thing to vault on
Instructions
Activity Description: Begin by having students practice vaulting over two boxes with several steps in between. Once students are comfortable, give them two vaults to practice and a set number of steps they are allowed to take between boxes (i.e. kong and thief vault, 3 steps between). Coaches can add in/subtract vault boxes or adjust their distances as necessary.
Coach Notes: This drill can help students mentally map their steps onto a space. Coaches should challenge students with large step sizes requiring powerful exit distances/strides in addition to awkwardly small steps. Coaches should also make sure intermediate students are forced to approach from different angles as well to help improve their step-mapping ability.

 
 
Wall Dips

Drill to develop strength for wall runs
Materials
Wall Space
Instructions
Duration: 5-10 minutes
Age/Experience: 8+ (Beginner to advanced)
Intensity: Moderate to high
Activity Description: Wall dips are an assistance exercise for the top out and can also be used to develop strength for groundwork and vaults. Students begin in support position on the wall and perform a dip, bending at the hip to create a slight “L” with their body. Students should try to avoid using their feet for assistance and should go as low as possible while maintaining tension in the upper back and shoulders.
Coach Notes: Coaches can have students wear socks to help avoid scrambling feet. Have students complete explosive sets of 3-5 wall dips unless finishing the day with a group conditioning challenge or incorporating as a maintenance exercise into a closing circuit. Advanced or strong intermediate students can attempt wall dips on a narrow surface (like the face of a vault box) or transition into cat hang at the bottom of each dip.

 
 
Tape Underbars

Drill to improve underbars
Materials
Bar, tape
Instructions
Duration: 10-15 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to advanced)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: This drill is an excellent way to both teach and improve underbar technique without fear of injury. Have students underbar through or over progressively difficult tape gaps. Coaches should be sure to create as many different types of gaps as possible - running underbars, reverse underbars, hurdle underbars, underbar clears, etc.
Coach Notes: For more advanced students, coaches should create tape webs that challenge students to underbar spaces that are tight both vertically and horizontally.

 
 
Lache Cat Drop

Lache then drop onto a precision trainer
Materials
Bar, precision trainer
Instructions
Duration: 10 minutes
Age/Experience: 8+ (Beginner to advanced)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: Have students begin hanging on a bar above a precision trainer or line on the ground. Students will initiate a slight swing and then release to precision the trainer below them on the backswing.
Coach Notes: This is a drill for cat drops and backwards laches. Coaches can adjust where the trainer is in relation to the bar students are hanging on - either just behind the bar or directly under it should be good. To emulate the cat drop more, coaches can place a tall vault box below the bar and have students hang on the bar with one foot on the face of the vault box. Students can then practice kicking lightly off of the vault box and dropping to a trainer directly below the bar.

 
 
Cat Pull

Practice going from Cat to Support
Materials
Wall Space
Instructions
Duration: 5-10 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to intermediate)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: Have students begin in cat hang on a low wall with one foot on the ground. Students pull to a high position, chest or belly-button to the wall (without adjusting hands), then fall back into cat, using the foot on the ground to assist as much as needed. They are not pulling to support or top-out, just repping a high pull in and out of the cat position. Intermediate students should practice cat pulls without floor assistance. High intermediate students can cat pull into a temporary support without hand adjustment if possible.
Coach Notes: Make sure students focus on pulling up and slightly in. They should not be trying to touch their chest to the wall – if possible, all students should aim to pull up until their chest is above the wall. A simple cue to is have them bring their belly-button to the top of the wall. Use foot assist as necessary. Coaches can add diagonal kicker at the base of the wall as a transition between floor assistance and cat pulls on the wall.

 
 
Stride to Wall Run

Wall run with stride as final step before jump
Materials
Wall run, vault boxes/ precision trainers
Instructions
Duration: 10-20 minutes
Age/Experience: 8+ (Beginner to advanced)
Intensity: Moderate to high
Activity Description: Coach begins with a series of simple wall-runs, then has students practice using a low vault box/precision trainer for the ultimate step before the wall. As students complete the small stride up to wall run, move the “stride” farther away from the wall. Repeat until students are no longer able to complete the wall run, or add a stride/plyo line at the beginning into the final stride wall run.
Coach Notes: One-legged cat aborts should be a prerequisite to this activity or taught concurrently to help reduce chance of injury. Coaches should choose a step-up that is no higher than the knee of the average student in class, and does not require excessive control during takeoff (i.e. no rails, unless it is for an advanced class).

 
 
Vault Hurdles

Vaulting with marked take off/ landing
Materials
Vault box, tape (optional), low vault boxes
Instructions
Duration: 10-20 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to advanced)
Intensity: Moderate to high
Activity Description: Begin by running students through a few practice vaults. Once students have warmed up the technique, have them practice the vault with a small hurdle on the approach side or small clear on the exit side. This could be taking off/landing behind a tape line or chalk mark, jumping from a low vault box, or clearing a low vault box. Increase the height and/or distance of the hurdle as students complete each successive level. Coaches can game-ify this activity more by giving students 3 lives to get through 10 hurdles of increasing difficulty.
Coach Notes: This activity can be done using a single vault focus or multiple vaults for intermediate/advanced groups. Coaches should make students aware that certain vaults apply better to certain physical scenarios – for instance, the kong or step vault will often be more effective when used to hurdle an approach obstacle than the lazy or dash, while the lazy/thief is extremely effective for hurdling/clearing obstacles on the exit side. For beginner and intermediate students, coaches should not have students try too many hurdle scenarios using vaults that aren’t “obvious.” Advanced students should be encouraged to experiment with awkward vaults in counter-intuitive situations, and should additionally be challenged with hurdles on both sides.

 
 
Lazy Takeoffs

practicing different lazy vault entrance techniques
Materials
vault obstacle
Instructions
Activity Description: Coaches begin by demonstrating the three types of lazy vault takeoff – swinging the inside foot, swinging the outside foot, and using a staggered “plyo” step a la the kong. Walk students through each type of lazy vault and explain the various advantages/disadvantages of the three (see Coach Notes).
Coach Notes: Generally, swinging the inside foot works best for slow-moving lazy vaults used in tight spaces or as a connecting vault in a flow line. Swinging the outside foot allows athletes to run the fastest into their lazy (this is often also called a “thief” vault) and generate more exit power. It also works best as a transition into the dash vault. The plyo approach can develop significant power, generally more so than the outside leg from a limited run-up, but requires a more diagonal approach angle and cannot be used with as much speed as the outside leg lazy/thief. The plyo lazy is also convenient as a transition from heavier impact since it is essentially a two-footed takeoff.

 
 
Flagging and Drop Knee Technique

introducing the ideas of flagging and drop knees to students
Materials
A wall
tape
chalk
Instructions
Activity Description: Set up several tape marks on a wall or use existing routes. Challenge students to focus on flagging and drop knees to extend their reach when traverse or ascending a wall.
Coach Notes: Coaches should be familiar with the basic concepts of flagging and drop knees from rock climbing. Drop knees will generally require some sort of ledge for the foot to stand on. Flagging can also be trained while traversing across poles/bar cages. This activity can be incredibly boring without the right set-up, coaches should consider replacing it with another unless comfortable with the techniques and space requirements involved. If coaches are comfortable, this activity is excellent for developing better climbing technique and coordination of all four limbs.

 
 
Pull to Support

practicing using a pull from cat position all the way to support
Materials
a wall
floor/diagonal kicker as needed
Instructions
Activity Description: Students follow the same general premise as the “Cat Pull” drill but now finish in support. Use the floor/diagonal kicker as needed.
Coach Notes: Coaches should still encourage students to pull up and not straight into the wall. Though students may find it easier to top out by pulling straight in for an actual climb-up, an emphasis on upward pulls will help them improve their overall pulling strength long-term. Remember, the drill here is not to do a fast or easy climb-up, it’s to pull to support.

 
 
Leapfrog Kongs

Kong onto box, then dive kong off
Materials
Vault box, 8 inch pads or resi mat
Instructions
Duration: 10 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to intermediate)
Intensity: Low
Activity Description: Have students kong up to a vault box lengthwise, then dive kong off the edge of the box onto mat stacks.
Coach Notes: This activity transitions best from ground kongs and can be warmed up by having students practice clearing their hands on a ground kong (clear with their feet the point where they plant their hands). This is very useful for students who are comfortable konging up onto obstacles but have trouble committing to clearing the obstacle. It is also useful for building up to dive kongs.

 
 
Vault Lasers

Vaulting while avoiding obstacles
Materials
Vault boxes, tape/string
Instructions
Duration: 10-20 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to advanced)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: Coach begins with a simple tape/thread web around several vault boxes. Students are challenged to adjust their basic vaults to fit through the web.
Coach Notes: This is an excellent introduction to thread vaults/rolls, and challenges students to be aware of the basic positions their bodies make when performing certain vaults. For beginner groups, coaches can use foam noodles or small PVC rods to create gaps for the students as opposed to a tape maze (this will likely save considerable reconstruction time). Coaches should challenge students not only to “thread” into and out of their vaults but also to adjust the width/height of various body parts during the vaults (i.e. kong with high vs. low hips, speed vault with low vs. high legs).

 
 
Mobility Twister

Twister while in a Cat hang
Materials
Wall, tape
Instructions
Duration: 5-10 minutes
Age/Experience: 10+ (Intermediate to Advanced)
Intensity: Moderate to high
Activity Description: Coaches place colored tape squares at varying heights on either side of student “hanging spots” on the wall. Have students begin in cat hang on the wall. For this variation, students will move their feet into colored squares instead of their hands. If students fail to get a position after 5 seconds or fall from the wall, they are “out.”
Coach Notes: For this variation, challenge students by calling “left foot” and “right foot” followed by the color of the intended square. Coaches should set squares in a pattern that challenges active mobility in diverse ways. A “V” pattern, with the hanging student’s foot at full extension near the base of the “V” is a good example.

 
 
Stride Straddles

Techinical drill that can help cue knee drive during the stride and develop awareness and stability in the mid-air position.
Materials
Two vault boxes/panel mats of equivalent height
Instructions
Duration: 10 minutes
Age/Experience: 8+ (Intermediate to Advanced)
Focus Skills: Jumping, Landing
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: Set up two obstacles (boxes or panel mats are perfect) between knee and hip height for the average student in your class, one just behind the student and the other just in front (1.5 feet of clearance or so on either side). Students will jump up and try to land standing in “stride”/split squat position, with one leg on the obstacle behind them and one in front of them. Once students are comfortable jumping into stride position with both left in front and right in front, have them try a plyo sequence – jumping into a left-leading stride, dropping to both feet, then immediately plyo-ing back up into a right-leading stride. Advanced students can try sets of 3-5 to help develop strength and coordination for bigger strides.
Coach Notes: This is another technical drill that may not work well for all classes, but should be done from time to time with students that are serious about training. This drill can help cue knee drive during the stride and develop awareness and stability in the mid-air position.

 
 
Reverse Drops

Like a burpee - but focusing on power rather than volume
Materials
Instructions
Activity Description: This is a quick strength-building drill students can do to better understand impact absorption and force production. Have students start in a push-up position, then dynamically tuck their legs into their four-point landing position, then “plyo” quickly into a vertical jump. Students can use vault boxes or tape to create concrete hurdles/box jump goals for themselves. Coaches can also time how fast students go from push-up to completing their vertical jump.
Coach Notes: Encourage students to be as explosive as possible on the first transition from push-up to crouch/four point landing. This is a weak transition for most beginners and young students, and will improve their ability to take impact and transition out of heavy landings.

 
 
roll to plyo

being able to connect a roll with a plyo
Materials
Instructions
Activity Description: Have students begin with standard forward shoulder rolls, then after 3-5 practice reps challenge them to plyo immediately once they roll to their feet. Coaches can have students plyo for distance on flat ground or try to roll straight into some type of box jump. Once students are comfortable with plyos out of a forward roll, have them attempt to plyo out of a backward shoulder roll (note – students roll backward and plyo normally, no backward plyos unless at coach’s discretion).
Coach Notes: To keep the drill interesting and challenge students, it can also be done with direction changes, for distance, or for height. For intermediate groups, coaches can have students roll to plyo out of a small drop.

 
 
Running Bounce Tac

Have students turn a bail from a cat into a tac/ precision jump
Materials
Slant wall/vault box, precision trainer
Instructions
10 minutes
Age/Experience: 8+ (Intermediate to advanced)
Focus Skills: Jumping, Landing, Climbing, Falling/Bailing
Intensity: Moderate to high
Activity Description: Have students begin with a medium distance running cat bail to a slanted surface (either a slant wall or the side of a vault box). Once students are comfortable doing the cat abort with no hands, set an obstacle off to the side for them to precision. Have students run in at an angle, then tac/cat “abort" plyo with two feet to the landing point. Challenge students by adjusting the approach angle/jump distance in relation to the landing.
Coach Notes: Coaches can also have more advanced students work running bounce tacs on flat walls – remember that for these, an angled approach will be extremely difficult compared to a straight approach.

 
 
Tac Pop/ Face Tac

Tac into crane
Materials
Vault box/slant wall
Instructions
Duration: 10 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to intermediate)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: For this drill, have students begin with a slightly slanted surface and move gradually to a straight wall/ledge. Students take a single step on the vertical face of the obstacle and tac directly up with slight forward momentum. The goal is to tac straight into crane/precision. Students should be comfortable with both tic tacs and wall runs before working this movement pattern on vertical surfaces.
Coach Notes: Coaches should be wary of trying this movement with students who are lacking mobility/confident foot placement since shinjuries can be common here.

 
 
Speed Ladder

Using a ladder for quick footwork and agility work
Materials
speed ladder, chalk, or lines on the ground
Instructions
Activity Description: Have students jog/jump in place for 1-2 minutes to loosen their lower body. Then, have students follow the coach through 5-10 speed ladder drills of increasing intensity (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iICTuTZCJyM the execution in these videos isn’t great but it is a good video list of options). These drills are excellent at warming students up for impact, and can also help develop better coordination. Coaches should try to emphasize minimal ground contact time and maximal eccentric speed when students drive their legs down.
Coach Notes: Speed ladder drills should always be done on hard floor, not spring floor (to teach the nervous system the best possible reaction speed). Encourage students to accelerate to a pace where they are still able to maintain technique - if students are unable to focus on quick contact and eccentric speed while maintaining coordination, they are going too quickly.

 
 
Superman Climb

Climb up wall while in a horizontal position
Materials
Two large boxes/walls
Instructions
Duration: 10 minutes
Age/Experience: 10+ (Intermediate to advanced)
Intensity: High
Activity Description: Have coaches place the boxes slightly farther apart then the average student is tall, or find appropriately sized chimney in the gym. Students begin with both hands on one wall, then place one foot on the opposing wall. Once they have three secure points of contact on the wall, lift the remaining foot. Begin with 5-10 second static holds, then have students move up and down. Once students are comfortable moving up and down, challenge students to climb to the top and transition to a cat hang then top out.
Coach Notes: This movement pattern requires more strength than the spider climb. Make sure students are physically able to hold themselves statically before allowing them to climb up or down. Advanced students can try wider chimney climbs, attempt jumping into the static hold (it’s possible, just very, very difficult), or transition from cat hang to chimney downclimb (this can sometimes start with a wall flag on wider chimneys – the only efficient use of the flagpole technique I have ever found in parkour).

 
 
Taped Climbing

Climbing Routes Made With Tape
Materials
Wall space, tape
Instructions
Duration: 10-20 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to advanced)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: Coach uses tape to set a climbing route or traverse along the wall. Use a tape arrow/double tape line to indicate starting and finishing holds for students.
Coach Notes: Coaches should ideally set multiple routes of varying difficulty. Routes should challenge whichever skills the coach wants to focus on that day/week. Use different colors of tape or chalk to mark the different routes.

 
 
Spider Climb

Climbing up/down structure with all 4 limbs using equal pressure
Materials
Two walls/ tall boxes
Instructions
Duration: Duration: 10 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to advanced)
Intensity: Moderate
Activity Description: Set the two tall boxes approximately double students’ shoulder-width apart, or choose an appropriately sized “chimney” in the gym. Have students go up with one foot on either wall, using hands as needed. Have students practice moving up and down in both the middle and side split positions.
Coach Notes: This movement pattern is not strenuous but requires solid strength and mobility. Coaches should make sure students with knee or hip injuries are aware of the strain before attempting. Once students are comfortable moving up and down the chimney with this technique, challenge them to jump into it a la Ninja Warrior.

Pole Cat Positions

Pole Cat Landing
Materials
Vertical Pole
Instructions
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to intermediate)
Intensity: Low
Activity Description: Have students practice the basic pole cat landing position on both sides. I always teach my students to land with both feet pointing in the same direction (top foot angled slightly in at 45-60 degree angle, bottom foot at a 45). If coaches also want to teach a “mixed foot” landing position to their students they can, although I wouldn’t suggest it as the primary technique. Once students are comfortable hanging/bouncing in position, challenge them to practice light jumps into correct pole cat position.
Coach Notes: As with any technical parkour movement, coaches should encourage students to be as consistent and perfect as possible when practicing their positioning. Consistency will be key when transitioning from just the pole cat position to actual pole cats.

 
 
Pancake Tacs

Tic Tac with 180 degree turn
Materials
Slanted vault box/quad steps, precision trainers
Instructions
Duration: 5-10 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to advanced)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: This drill can be done on a single slanted obstacle or multiples as in the Quad Step. It can also be expanded to ledge/rail running practice on precision trainers. Students should always start on a single obstacle until they feel comfortable with the technique. Have students begin by practicing a two-step tac with a 180 degree turn (“pancake” tac, blame APEX Denver coaches for the name) to precision landing. Students should always initiate this movement with their outside leg (i.e. their first step on the obstacle is with the right foot if the obstacle is on their left side) if possible. This will not only make the full turn easier but will also create more friction during the second step. Once students are able to stride into and out of this simple pancake turn coaches can add additional obstacles or complex approaches/exits.
Coach Notes: Coaches can use this movement pattern as an assistance drill for tic tacs, strides, or rail running/balance. It is also an excellent “flow” transition between vaults and can be used to transition to vault work.

 
 
extreme skipping

learning to skip with power
Materials
open space
Instructions
Activity Description: This is a silly activity that can help students work on knee drive and form maintenance in the air. Have students start by skipping from one end of the floor to the other (ideally this is done on open hard/foam floor…can be done on spring floor if necessary). Then, have students do the same thing going back but trying to skip as high as possible without losing their form. Have students skip across the floor as high as possible 3-5 times. Then, have students try to maintain height and form while skipping across the floor as quickly as possible (switch the emphasis from height to speed). Here, coaches may be able to identify lagging issues between the lower and upper body that will become apparent in stride work later on. Have students skip quickly across 3-5 times.
Coach Notes: For many students, you will see instability/poor bracing in the midsection that shows itself as poor posture on high skips. This can help coaches identify problems in strides, since many times the problem isn’t from stride technique but is rather a strength/posture issue. This drill can be boring if coaches try to treat it seriously, so allow yourself and the students to be goofy during the drill as long as they are maintaining solid form and striving for height/speed when appropriate.

 
 
support to cat negatives

going from on top of a wall to cat position
Materials
a wall
Instructions
Activity Description: This drill can help reinforce the basic cat hang position and give coaches an assessment tool for when students are ready to move on to actual cat leaps/cat leap variations. Have students start in a support position with feet on the wall, then slowly drop into a cat hang. Hold for 3 seconds before releasing the cat hang. At first, allow students to use back edges of the wall/elbows/chest to get comfortable with the movement pattern. Then, eliminate easy options until students are able to move from support to cat with just their hands and feet touching the wall. Once students are able to transition between support and cat hang, challenge students to down-climb from a standing position into a cat hang. This will be quite easy for most on a standard wall. Coaches can add challenge by having students down-climb to cat with various obstacles in front of their bodies that limit movement on the wall.

 
 
Running Box Jump/Gallop Plyos

drilling plyos and kong precisions
Materials
2-3 stations with obstacles of varying heights
Instructions
Activity Description: This is another simple drill for plyos and kong precisions. Create two or three stations using obstacles of varying heights. Challenge students to running box jump/gallop plyo (same technique, different terminology) to the top of each obstacle. Once students seems comfortable with the heights or have maxed out on an obstacle, challenge them to hurdle a small obstacle or hit the same running plyo from farther away.
Coach Notes: Coaches should be sure that students are using good running plyo tech (similar to basketball players doing a two-footed dunk) and maintaining a stable core (no flopping around at the midsection during takeoff or landing). Coaches should also be sure that when testing height, obstacles have solid bail options to minimize shin potential.

 
 
tac clear

practicing to tic tac and land over something
Materials
tape pvc vault box
Instructions
Activity Description: Once students are comfortable with basic tic tacs, coach uses tape/broomstick/PVC/vault box to create obstacles for students to clear. Coach can also add a trainer to precision beyond the clear.
Coach Notes: If coach is using tape, extend the drill by adjusting tape to challenge tac shapes in the air for more advanced students. For all students, coaches should have students begin by working with a small run-up then increasing run-up size as they get more comfortable.

 
 
Quad Step

using quad steps or 4 vault boxes to slowly increase competence and confidence with basic movements in the group
Materials
Instructions
Activity Description: Place four quad step-styled obstacles at staggered intervals. Students make their way across using the appropriate focus skills (strides, plyos, catbacks, ground kongs, etc.)
Coach Notes: Have students begin with a simple variation, then challenge them by increasing the distance between obstacles or increasing movement complexity (i.e. switch stride, skip a quad step, add a twist)
