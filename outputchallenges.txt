List of challenges
 

 
 
Balance Catch

Partner drill where one person balances while catching
Materials
Precision trainers, tennis balls
Instructions
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to Intermediate)
Intensity: Low
Activity Description: Have students partner up. One student balances on the precision trainer while the other tosses them a tennis ball. Students play catch and try not to fall off of the precision trainer. Coaches can make this game more difficult by having both students balance on trainers or by having the student on the ground call “right/left” (in reference to the catching hand) when tossing the ball to their balancing partner.
Coach Notes: Coaches should make sure students are tossing the ball underhanded. Coaches should also position students away from each other to help them stay focused/able to track their ball.

 
 
Movement Dice

using dice to randomly generate a run then trying to execute it
Materials
dice or phone
Instructions
Activity Description: For each number on a six-sided die, the coach chooses a movement (for instance, 1 = speed vault, 2 = dash, 3 = kong, 4 = lazy, 5 = turn, 6 = reverse). The students have to build a line and course out of vault boxes that suites six rolls of the dice. That is, if a coach rolls 2,5,6,4,2,1 the students will build a setup where dash-turn vault-reverse-lazy-dash-speed makes sense. This helps students work on awkward vault transitions and also visualize how certain movements fit into specific spaces. Students are allowed to bring in vault boxes but once a box is placed it cannot be moved. Students can start in different parts of the “course” and try to complete the same sequence of movements for added difficulty.
Coach Notes: Coaches can roll the dice (or use a similar phone app) six times at the beginning of the activity or let the students build their line/course one roll at a time a la “Add On.” This game is somewhat similar to Add On, but the randomization creates opportunities for students to work on awkward or unfamiliar vault transitions on both sides that they wouldn’t necessarily create for themselves. Coaches should pick movements that emphasize the focus skills and also tend to flow well into each other. Coaches can also mix focus skills with advanced classes.

 
 
First Try or Die

practicing doing something with only one attempt
Materials
Instructions
Activity Description: The coach selects a movement pattern/skill and 3-10 challenges. Each student is allowed one attempt to complete/stick/land each challenge. Students have a 10-60 second (depending on the difficulty/risk of the challenge and size of the class) time limit to attempt each challenge.
Coach Notes: Because students only get one attempt, the challenges should not be outrageously difficult. This drill is used best to help students develop good commitment habits or prepare for skill/style competitions.

 
 
Tennis Catch

using a tennis ball to work on the skill of being aware and prepared during and after landing
Materials
one tennis ball per pair of students.
Jump trainer or tape or chalk or a real world jump
Instructions
Name: Tennis Catch
Activity Type: Game, Drill
Duration: 5-10 minutes
Age/Experience: 8+ (Beginner to Advanced)
Equipment: Precision trainers, tennis balls (1 per pair of students), tape optional
Focus Skills: Jumping, Landing, Falling/Bailing, Balance
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: Set up several basic precision jumps at ground level. Have students practice them to stick 2-4 times. Students can play with the coach or in pairs. Once students are comfortable, the coach/their partner will try to toss them a tennis ball mid-jump. For Level 1, the student will catch the tennis ball then stick the jump. For Level 2, the coach will kneel behind an obstacle (like a vault box) so the student can’t see them when they toss the ball. For Level 3, the student will start the jump with their eyes closed, open them in the air, then try to catch the ball and stick the jump.
Coach Notes: Since this game involves a lot of hand/foot/eye coordination, it is best to do on trainers or other low obstacles until students are very comfortable. Tape can also be substituted for trainers for beginner groups. Coach should demonstrate one round before allowing the students to play in pairs.

 
 
Catch the Baby

practicing quick response in the middle of movements
Materials
shirt/rag/beanbag/babydoll
Instructions
Activity Description: Take a clean shirt/rag/bean bag and challenge students to catch it in the middle of various movements - for example Cat Leaps(running upwards, standing upwards, small level cat leaps, etc.).
Coach Notes: This game should be played primarily with students who are strong enough and technically comfortable enough to cat leap or cat bail with one hand. As always, encourage students to lead with their feet on the wall - this will also give them more time to spot and catch the shirt/bean bag. Escalate the difficulty of cat leaps gradually, after students have completed the previous cat leap with each hand at least twice in a row.

 
 
Drop Shapes

create fun and challenging shapes for students to practice dropping through without touching
Materials
Instructions
Activity Description: Coach sets a takeoff obstacle with a drop, then creates a tape web surrounding that obstacle that gives students opportunities to work on dropping through various challenging shapes. The tape should be at least hip height on the coach, if not slightly higher - this will give the students time to get out of any awkward position they may have been in before they hit the ground. Once the tape web is destroyed, coaches can extend the game by having students create their own tape shapes that are fun, safe, and challenging.
Coach Notes: Coaches can help keep this activity safe by asking students to clarify which jump they are doing before they go. Coaches can also penalize bad landings. Coaches may want to mat the landing area with a sting mat or 8” for beginner groups and most 6-10 year olds.

 
 
cat abort pre

can you fail a cat and still land precisely
Materials
wall vault box precision trainers tape
Instructions
Activity Type: This drill will challenge students to control their time on the wall during a cat abort. Once students are comfortable with cat aborts from varying distances and heights, the coach can place a small obstacle (box, trainer, tape mark) near the floor and have students attempt to cat abort the wall then land on the obstacle. Coaches can have students warm up to this with drops from a cat hang to precision. This can also be used as a warm-up or introduction to basic cat drop technique used for descents. Coaches should challenge students by adjusting the distance and angle of the cat drop, in addition to the distance and angle of the obstacle they are landing on (students should be comfortable hitting the wall and deadening impact to land on a close obstacle, or bouncing off the wall to a farther landing point).
Coach Notes: Coaches should encourage students to think primarily about the cat abort, then adjust to land on the obstacle once they touch the wall. As with Cat Max Out!!! coaches should be conscious of healthy ankles for students.

 
 
Cast Top Out

A challenging worm cast top out
Materials
Instructions
Activity Description: Have students start in support and try to “worm” or cast up to their feet. Students can also clear in a kong (as in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Loix7mAFHNw at 1:27) or transition into a thief vault.
Coach Notes: This drill can help students gain strength and coordination in their top out. While the cast is not the most efficient way to top out, it is fun and translates to several other movements including cast backs, swing casts, and worm casts.

 
 
lava hands

quickly reacting to a caller to catch a specific part of a wall
Materials
tape/chalk and walls
Instructions
Activity Description: Choose a wide wall and use different colors of tape/chalk to
outline rectangular hand “grips” at the top of the wall for students (grips can be staggered widths to add confusion). Coach counts down from three, then calls the color of the “grips” that the student should cat (i.e. 3, 2, 1, “yellow”). The student should have both hands fully inside the correctly colored rectangle – either one hand per rectangle or both hands in one rectangle. Coach can add plyos or strides into the ultimate cat leap takeoff for additional challenge.
Coach Notes: Coach should make sure to remind students to lead with their feet. Students should always prioritize good and safe foot contact on the wall over hand placement, especially beginner students.

 
 
10 x 10

Choose 10 challenges, stick each 10 times
Materials
All
Instructions
Duration: 15-20 minutes
Age/Experience: 8+ (Beginner to Advanced)
Intensity: Moderate to high
Activity Description: Coach picks a movement pattern or skill. The coach or student chooses 10 different challenges incorporating the pattern/skill and sticks each 10 times.
Coach Notes: Coaches should avoid doing 10x10 with young students who have focus issues. Coaches should not use 10x10 for high impact or high risk movements like drop precisions/strides or max out cat leaps. 10x10 can occasionally take 30-45 minutes, and should be used sparingly for beginner classes unless it is done as a group effort (i.e. the entire group has to collectively stick each challenge 10 times). 10x10 is an excellent drill for honing the skills and mental game of intermediate/advanced students.

 
 
Human Knot

Everyone in the group is holding hands and stuck in a knot, everyone has to untangle the knot
Materials
5 or more people
Instructions
Have everyone reach across a circle and hold hands with two other people. The goal is to untangle the circle in as little time as possible - this method may result in multiple circles, possibly interlinked.
Semi-perfect Mode: Make sure right hands hold left hands and left hands hold right hands by orienting right hands face down and left hands face up as you reach across the circle.
Perfect Mode:
Have everyone hold hands in a circle - and remember who their left hand holds and who their right hand holds. mix up the circle - then regain holding those people's hands in the same orientation. The goal is to return to the original circle.
hard mode - no talking
impossible mode - blindfolded
