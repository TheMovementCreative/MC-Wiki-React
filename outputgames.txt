xxxxScramble

Go from Point A to Point B in as few movements as possible
Materials
Precision trainers, vault boxes optional
How to Play
Duration: 5-10 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to Advanced)
Intensity: Low to high
Activity Description: Scramble 10-15 precisions trainers or other obstacles in a large circle or square. Challenge students to get from one point to another across the trainer scramble in as few movements as possible, using only the focus skill. Coaches can move points A and B or shuffle the obstacles to provide variation as the game progresses.
Coach Notes: For less experienced groups, try to choose focus skills that emphasize slow, precise movement over speed. The fall zones can be particularly bad for this activity and coaches should help students be aware of that.

 
 
xxxxxcats vs crabs

infection tag in quadrupedal
Materials
How to Play
Activity Description: Split the class into two groups. One group will play as “Cats,” the other group as “Crabs.” The Cat group will move in a cat crawl or standard QM and the Crab group will move in a crab crawl or table position for the entire game. The goal for the Crab team is to tag Cat students, turning them into Crabs. The goal for the Cats is to survive 60 seconds of play without being turned into a Crab, or to be the last Cat standing. It is essentially “zombie tag” using the cat and crab QM positions. Crabs can only tag Cats with their pincers (hands, no feet).
Coach Notes: Coaches should create a play area that gives Cats the ability to out-maneuver/dodge Crabs. Try to keep the play area large if possible. After each game, have students keep the same teams but switch positions (i.e. Cats become Crabs, Crabs become Cats) and play best of 5.

xxxQM Avoidance

Move through space while QMing and avoiding others
Materials
Floor Space
How to Play
Duration: 5 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner)
Intensity: Low
Activity Description: Have students start on opposite sides of the floor (for younger kids) or in a circle (for older kids/adults). Their goal is to reach the other side of the floor/circle without touching any other students. If they touch another student, they get “knocked out” and have to fall to the ground.
Coach Notes: This is a good game for young kids and adult groups. For young kids, it can help start class of with a slow, controlled pace - kids should be encouraged to move carefully and made aware that this game is not a race. For adults, emphasize control, fluid movement, and route planning/adapting to the changing environment. This game is also a good way to consolidate the various QM techniques once they have been learned since it forces participants to use them in a variety of scenarios.

 
 
Call your Shot

high-scoring can you put your foot on that thing and stay there
Materials
How to Play
Activity Description: To set up “Call Your Shot,” coaches will need a takeoff point or obstacle and several landing options. Landing options could be a vault box, lines on the floor, a mat, trainers, chalk marks, or anything else the coach feels is appropriate for the group. Coaches assign a point value to each of the landing options based on difficulty (i.e. students get 5 points for sticking the hardest one, 3 for the medium, and 1 for the easiest). Students line up single file behind the takeoff point and have to call out which landing option they are going to stick. If they make it, they get the appropriate number of points. If they don’t make it, they get zero points. Students have 10 total attempts to rack up points and have to try each landing option at least once.
Coach Notes: This game is more fun and fair when a high number of diverse landing options are in play. As always, coaches should make sure each option is as safe as possible. Remind students that they only get points for sticking the jump they call out beforehand - this should keep competitive students from throwing themselves at difficult jumps they aren’t ready for.

 
 
xxxStairway to Heaven

like build a bridge but focused on ascending
Materials
ascending movable obstacles
How to Play
Activity Description: This is a great drill for developing explosive power and can be done communally, with each student adding a piece as in “Build A Bridge,” or with the coach setting a route before class and then allowing students to make changes once they complete the set route. The goal is to build an ascending/descending sequence of obstacles that challenges students to redirect force effectively from different positions (plyos, strides, cat leaps, catbacks, dynos, etc.). The sequence should be between 4 and 7 moves long. It should be difficult to do perfectly, but not terribly difficult to complete. If students find it too easy once completed, that is the perfect chance to let them alter the course.
Coach Notes: Coaches should keep in mind the age, health, and experience level of their students when building their stairway. The stairway can ascend, descend, and change direction to provide diverse movement challenge options. The stairway can focus on one skill (all plyos) or incorporate multiple focus skills. This can be an excellent game to use for parent showcases since it demonstrates a variety of skills and has a high level of student creation/participation. Coaches can also have students work in groups to create multiple stairways, then share theirs with the class for everyone to try.

 
 
xxxS-T-I-C-K

like horse but for parkour
Materials
How to Play
Activity Description: Students get into groups and follow the same rules as H-O-R-S-E in basketball, using parkour challenges based around the focus skill. Only challenges that the students stick/complete count. For more advanced groups, students can add in options like “crane only,” “bounce to cat on purpose,” “front flip out,” etc. Coaches can allow groups to choose their own challenges with a rotating leader or can lead the entire class through one big game.
Coach Notes: Have students group up with peers that are at/near their skill level. For younger or newer groups, it can be beneficial to have the coach lead students through a practice game. Coaches should be monitoring student challenges for safety/diversity. Coaches can always pop into a group and give new challenges to boring groups. Allow students to have access to all mobile obstacles for more variety, especially in beginner groups.

 
 
xxxSurprise Stick

Testing response time with different challanges
Materials
Precision trainers, vault boxes, tape
How to Play
Duration: 10-15 minutes
Age/Experience: 8+ (Beginner to Advanced)
Intensity: Moderate
Activity Description: Split students into groups of three and give each group five precision trainers. Arrange four of the trainers in a square with the other precision trainer set up as their takeoff (for vaulting, the fifth trainer would be a vault box…for swinging, a bar…for climbing, a wall to cat back/cat 180 from). Tell students the trainers in the square are numbered 1-4 and let them know the orientation (going off a clock’s orientation, I use the 9 o’clock – or trainer on the left side of the square - as my “1,” the 12 o’clock as my “2,” 3 o’clock as my “3,” and 6 o’clock as my “4.” Coaches should always use the same orientation once set to avoid confusion).
For Jumping/Landing: Students stand a medium distance from the takeoff trainer. When they jump to the takeoff trainer, the coach/next student in line will call out a number between 1 and 4. The student has to hear this number in the air, land on the takeoff trainer, then plyo to the corresponding trainer in the square.
For Vaulting: The coach sets a vault box on the floor with precision trainers arranged in a square, triangle, or line behind the box. The trainers should be at a distance that is challenging but repeatable. The coach then places a tape line two steps before the takeoff point for the vault box. The coach/next in line calls out the landing number when the student hits the tape line.
For Swinging: The coach sets several precision trainers in a pattern where the student cannot see the landing from the bar (coach can use a vault box or other obstacle to hide the landing, or have students start with their backs to the landing and do a pivot turn into the lache). The coach/next in line calls out a landing number when the student is on their backswing (if using the hurdle landing) or on the pivot (if starting facing away).
For Climbing: The coach sets several trainers in a pattern away from a wall. The student starts with their back to the wall and has to catback/cat180 to the trainer. The coach/next in line calls out a landing number when the student starts to pull for the catback.
Coach Notes: The coach should begin by calling each time during the first round. Once students understand the timing, allow next in line to start calling. Make sure students understand this game is about reacting and adjusting, not trying to trick your friends. If students are unable to call at the right time, take away that privilege. For beginner/intermediate groups, coaches can substitute tape lines on the floor or polyspots for precision trainers to help avoid ankle injuries.

 
 
Wheel of Fortune

Multi-tasking while moving in a circle
Materials
1-3 soft soccer/ kickballs, open floor space
How to Play
Duration: 10-15 minutes
Age/Experience: 8+ (Beginner to Advanced)
Intensity: Moderate to high
Activity Description: Take a soccer ball or soft floor ball. Have students circle up and start by kicking the ball lightly around the circle while doing a quick circuit of joint rotations. Encourage students to pass the ball with control as soon as they receive it. After 2-3 minutes, have students pass while bouncing lightly on both feet, then one foot at a time, then forward and backward, then side to side. Have students do 15-25 reps of each bouncing pattern. Next, have the entire circle shuffle slowly clockwise while passing the ball. Continue for 1-2 minutes. Have students rest for 30 seconds, then add in a second ball if applicable. Repeat the rotating circle with two balls on the ground at once. Finish by accelerating the shuffle speed with both balls in play for the final 45 seconds, or by adding a third ball for the final minute.
Coach Notes: This game is difficult to play when splitting space with multiple classes. Coaches should encourage students, especially young ones, to pass the ball with control each time. Coaches can penalize wild/dangerous passes with burpees, pushups, wall-sits, etc. Coaches can make the rotating section more difficult by accelerating/decelerating shuffle speed or changing rotation direction for more advanced groups. Encourage students in more advanced groups to avoid calling names when passing the ball. This will help students focus on reactivity.

 
 
xxxQM Laser Race

racing through a laser maze that requires good crawling techinque
Materials
tape or paracord with bells
How to Play
Activity Description: Coach sets a tape web varying from knee to chest-height on the average student. Students have to navigate through the tape web using various QM techniques. A course can be set for time, students can race through a course, or coaches can set a conditioning punishment for each “laser” the student touches.
Coach Notes: Students can use either a variety of techniques to navigate the course or focus on one specific technique. Coaches should make sure students are challenging themselves to maintain good technique (i.e. no knees, elbows, bellies on the ground). This game can work as a great conditioning closer for the upper body if the course stays close to the ground.

 
 
Weatherman

Coach calls out different "weather" that corresponds to different challenges
Materials
None
How to Play
Duration: 5-15 minutes
Age/Experience: 6+ (Beginner to Advanced)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: This is a game from Sebastien Foucan and Forrest Mahop. The coach is the “weatherman,” and calls out different types of weather that correspond to different challenges for the students. For instance: Lava – floor is lava, Flood – students have to stay above a certain point in the gym (higher than lava), Blizzard – students meet in the middle of the gym and huddle up to “stay warm,” Earthquake – students lie down wherever they are, Hail – students sit in full squat wherever they are with hands on their heads, Sunburn – students have to hide so that the coach can’t see them, Rock Slide – students have to get off whatever obstacle they are on and reach a point on the floor. These are just some examples, coaches can create or rename as many new conditions as they like so long as they explain it to the students before the game starts!
Coach Notes: Coaches should try to start with only 3 or 4 conditions then add new conditions in as students get warmer/become more comfortable with the game. Coaches can rename or rework conditions to isolate certain focus skills, or leave it up to the students how much they want to “use” their parkour throughout the game. This is a great team-building exercise for new groups that are getting used to each other, and works surprisingly well with both kids and adults. For older groups, coaches may want to preface the silliness of the game by reminding students that it is a chance to work on improvisation, reaction, strategy, and team-building.

 
 
xxxxxxLava Hands

Climbing game similar to Twister
Materials
Wall, tape/ chalk
How to Play
Duration: 10-15 minutes
Age/Experience: 8+ (Beginner to Advanced)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: Choose a wide wall and use different colors of tape/chalk to
outline rectangular hand “grips” at the top of the wall for students (grips can be staggered widths to add confusion). Coach counts down from three, then calls the color of the “grips” that the student should cat (i.e. 3, 2, 1, “yellow”). The student should have both hands fully inside the correctly colored rectangle – either one hand per rectangle or both hands in one rectangle. Coach can add plyos or strides into the ultimate cat leap takeoff for additional challenge.
Coach Notes: Coach should make sure to remind students to lead with their feet. Students should always prioritize good and safe foot contact on the wall over hand placement, especially beginner students.

 
 
Infection Tag

infection tag
Materials
infectors
How to Play
Let’s see who can evade the crowd for the longest period of time.
Works well in any setting.
Game balance is a function of play space and movement types:
Generally, the infected should have the harder movement as they will quickly be able to work together to gang up on prey.
The larger the boundaries, the more they favor the un-infected.
Stay uninfected as long as you can.
One person starts as ‘it’ (aka: patient 0)
When they tag someone, that person becomes infected and becomes ‘it’ together with patient 0.
Game ends when all players are infected.
You can give the infected and the healthy different movement patterns.
Cats and Crabs: QM Variant
Infected move in QM with belly up, or the ‘crabs’.
Evaders move in QM with belly down, or the ‘cats.’
Lemurs: Feet are glued together, and must tuck jump to move.
Slugs: Not allowed to support on limbs, so you must roll around to move.
Flamingoes: Can only move on one leg.

 
 
Around The World

like around the world but for parkour instead of basketball
Materials
How to Play
Activity Description: The coach sets 6-10 focus-appropriate challenges of varying difficulty in a sequence around the gym. Students have to stick/complete each in order. If a student fails to complete one of the jumps, she has to start again at the beginning of the sequence.
Coach Notes: Coaches can have groups of students choose their own challenges or run the class through one big game. “Around the World” often works best when the coach runs the entire class through a sequence of their design then (once completed) allows the class to break into individual groups. Coaches should strive to set challenges that address a variety of strengths - not just power or control or confidence challenges exclusively. Coaches should keep in mind that challenges should get more difficult as the students progress, otherwise students may finish too quickly.

 
 
David Belle pro traceur Graffiti

like tony hawk pro skater
Materials
chalk
How to Play
Get people to climb and swing through an environment exhaustively without asking for any particular technique.
Requires a three-dimensional climbing area, with various chalk rings set throughout it.
Chalk rings don’t need to be on the actual structure, they can be simply on the floor within jumping distance.
Players also need a mark of sorts, such as chalk, or uniquely colored bandanas.
Get your initials on every ‘summit’ before time runs out.
Ground is lava…
Choose your level:
All feet/legs allowed.
One foot/legs allowed.
No feet/legs allowed.
Summits: rings/drawing spaces set up throughout game area.
Flags: your initials.
Climbing.
Swinging.
Jumping.
Marking.
A player may not travel directly from one summit to the next.
If summit must be jumped to, players can totally use at least one leg. Novices will likely need two.
None so far.

 
 
Reach/Escape

a two person tag game
Materials
bandanas can be helpful
How to Play
Students will have the opportunity to test comfort with their skills through a chase on a speed course.
Notes:
Create a course with start and finish point if one does not exist already.
Make sure it has features on which to perform techniques of the day.
Tag-type games are more frequently a host to injuries than others. Priority is on safety and well-being, NOT on winning.
To decrease risk, use balance trainers and the like to set a ground is lava course, forcing students to be more aware of their movement than they are of the other’s.
Set a starting line and finish line.
Students partner up.
Decide on a first chaser and a first evader. Next turn through the course, they will switch roles.
Evader starts on starting line, and may dictate the amount of lead distance they want from their chaser.
For example, Gabe starts on the line and wants Jesse to start five meters behind him.
Distance may also include a location that forces chaser to round a corner.
Chase starts only when evader takes their first step.
Chase ‘ends’ when the evader either reaches the end of the course or when chaser tags the evader.
However, regardless of whether chaser has caught the escapee, make sure students complete the course in full.

 
 
Parkour Dodgeball

dodgeball using parkour techniques
Materials
1-3 soft dodgeballs
How to Play
Duration: 10 minutes
Age/Experience: 7+ (Beginner to Advanced)
Intensity: Moderate to high
Activity Description: An Unparalleled Movement classic, begin with students moving through a small section of the gym while dodging throws from the coach/coaches. Once students have settled into the game, coaches can give students partial or full access to the gym and allow several free-for-all rounds. Coaches can designate certain areas “safe havens” that are accessible by unlocking one of the focus skills - sticking a precision, hitting a cat leap, climbing on top of a wall, etc.
Coach Notes: I would suggest coaches always start this game as exclusive “throwers” with the students dodging. This lets coaches set the tone for the intensity/pace of the game and makes a better impression on any parents that may be watching the class. Coaches should always remind students that safety is a priority over dodging, and can place any trouble spots in the gym off-limits during play for beginner groups.

 
 
jump/cat around the world

playing around the world with jumps/cats instead of basketball shots
Materials
a bunch of cat leaps for a circuit
How to Play
Activity Description: This drill will challenge students to develop static strength and confidence in their cat hang. Set up several cat leaps to low obstacles, several that force students to jump up (preferably over a gap, running or standing), and several appropriately sized level cat leaps. Challenge students to play “Around the World” with the cat leap variations, completing each one in sequence with either a 3-second static hold in cat hang or a climb-up (depending on the level of the class) to confirm a successful cat leap.
Coach Notes: The difficulty should be scaled to the level of the class. Coaches can then adjust the order of the cat leaps to make the overall sequence more challenging, or add additional cat leaps.

 
 
Match! Twister

Game where students have to play Twister while in a cat hang
Materials
Wall Tape
How to Play
Duration: 10-15 minutes
Age/Experience: 8+ (Intermediate to Advanced)
Intensity: Moderate to high
Activity Description: Coaches place squares of colored tape at small intervals along a wall. Students hang in cat. When coach calls a color, the student has to have their hands on that color (could be one or two squares). If coach calls “Match” then a color, the student has to have both hands inside the same square of that color. Students need to complete the command within 1 full second of coach saying it to avoid being “out.”
Coach Notes: Coaches can incorporate overhangs, cutouts, bars, wall ledges, etc. to make the game more challenging and diverse. Coaches can either let students who complete each round rest before attempting the next one or challenge them to stay in cat for multiple rounds without dropping. Coaches should decide this based on the intended intensity and the experience/strength level of the group.

 
 
Build a Bridge

Students need to complete challenge before moving through obstacles
Materials
1-3 precision trainers per student
How to Play
Duration: 15-20 minutes
Age/Experience: 5+ (Beginner to Advanced)
Intensity: Low to moderate
Activity Description: Coaches begin by giving each student one precision trainer. Students start at “Point A” and use their trainers to collectively build a bridge to “Point B.” The game begins when the coach sets down the first trainer. After each student has completed the first trainer (stuck the pre, plyo’d, QM’d, balanced, etc. depending on the skill focus the coach chooses) the first student in line can lay down the next piece of the “bridge.” The entire class must then complete the existing bridge without falling. If the class is successful, the next student in line adds their piece. If unsuccessful, continue until class is able to complete the existing bridge. The game ends when the class is able to build a bridge all the way to Point B and complete it without falling.
Coach Notes: Encourage students to see this as a teamwork challenge - if the entire team cannot complete the bridge, no one wins. Coaches should choose a Point B that is suitably challenging for the number of pieces given to the students. Students should not just be able to lay down pieces and walk all the way across without using the focus skill. Coaches can make the game more stressful for students by removing an existing piece of the bridge each time someone falls.

 
 
Pick-Up-Cup

a balance coordination game
Materials
rail trainers
solo cups
How to Play
Activity Description: Create a small course of rail trainers and place 5-10 solo cups at intervals on either side of the trainers. Students have to balance through the entire course while picking up cups without falling off or smashing the cups.
Coach Notes: Coaches can use something other than cups, they’re just convenient because they are light, cheap, and stackable. Coaches should implement consequences for breaking cups, especially with younger groups, to discourage students from using the cups to balance and inevitably crushing them on the ground.

 
 
QM Sumo

Two players move in QM in a confined space to steal a handkerchief from the other's waistband.
Materials
Two players, two handkerchiefs, cones or chalk
How to Play
1. Set up appropriately-sized boundaries using cones or chalk, such as a 15ft square or circle.
2. Each player sticks their handkerchief in the back of their waistband with roughly half of it protruding.
3. Players may only move in the space using QM and rolling techniques. No running or walking, and no going outside the boundaries.
4. The first player to steal the other's handkerchief wins.

 
 
PDQ

fast-paced turn-based jumping and dodging game
Materials
2 or more people that can jump
How to Play

everyone starts in a circle with their hands in, the past winner or a new person counts an order for the players and says PDQ and everyone jumps back
play proceeds in turn order, players can take a step and a jump only on their turn or in order to dodge the attack of the player who's turn it is
if your foot is stepped on or if you move when it is not your turn then you are out
last player standing wins


 
 
Ouroboros

A game of tag on a loop where every player is trying to tag the person ahead of them.
Materials
Two or more players, a looped course with multiple obstacles.
How to Play

Space players evenly around the loop
Players must travel around the loop in one direction only
Players are trying to tag the player ahead of them on the loop.
When a player is tagged, they are out and quickly leave the loop, and their tagger's next target is the person ahead of them.
When two players are left, they are each trying to tag each other, but must do so by catching up to them from behind (a player cannot turn around and tag the person behind them)
The last player standing wins.

Crab Soccer

Traditional soccer played in crab formation
Materials
Some kind of ball - some kind of goal or goals
How to Play
Split students into two groups. Play soccer in the crab position - coaches can play for time or first team to 5, 7, 11 points, etc.
Coaches can make goals on the wall out of tape, or use actual mini-soccer/hockey goals if they are lying around. Play best of 3 to give students the most exercise and the chance to win at least one game. Gamers could agree to penalize any students who take their hands off the ground to move and duck walk instead.
